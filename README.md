# Movie-Data-Analysis-Project-1-
Project 1: Explanatory Data Analysis &amp; Data Presentation (Movies Dataset) Project Brief for Self-Coders Here you´ll have the opportunity to code major parts of Project 1 on your own. If you need any help or inspiration, have a look at the Videos or the Jupyter Notebook with the full code.   Keep in mind that it´s all about getting the right results/conclusions. It´s not about finding the identical code. Things can be coded in many different ways. Even if you come to the same conclusions, it´s very unlikely that we have the very same code. Data Import and first Inspection Import the movies dataset from the CSV file "movies_complete.csv". Inspect the data.
